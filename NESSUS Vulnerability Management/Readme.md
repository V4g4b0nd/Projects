<h1>Vulnerability management using Nessus</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Using Nessus essentials vulnerability management we are scanning a Windows 10 VM for vulnerabilities that are present and trying to remediate it.
<br />

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
  <b>Nessus Essentials</b> <br/>
  <b>Deployed Windows 10 VM in Virtual box</b>
 
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p align="Left">
Set up a VM in Virtual box with windows 10 and bridged adapter settings<br />

<br />
Test connectivity using the PING command from host machine to the VM (Might need to allow SMTP in firewall or Disable Firewall)<br />
 <br/>
Create a new basic network scan with Nessus<br />

<h3>Credential Scanning</h3>
<p align="Left">
We need to change some settings in VM before the credentials scan (Since the system is not Domain enrolled)<br />
     1. Enable Remote registry in services.msc – To allow remote hosts to look through registry for vulnerabilities

<br />
     2. Turn On network discovery, file and printer sharing in Control Panel 
<br />
     3. Change Never Notify In UAC – User access control (Never do this in production) <br/>

<br />
     4. Add a key in registry to allow the remote account to connect (This is to Further disable UAC) <br/>
        Inside Registry > Computer>hkeylocalmac>Softw>MicrosoWindo>Currentvers>Policies>system > Add Dword Named LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and change value to 1 
        <br/><img src="https://imgur.com/crv6A1J.png" height="30%" width="30%" alt="Registry"/>
<br />
Restart the VM, and add credentials inside configure option nessus <br/>

<br/>

 For lowering the risk we must do these remediations, If inside an organistaion, we must start with thirdparty patching followed by OS patching to deploy frequent updates after testing for vulnerabilities
in test environment<br/>
