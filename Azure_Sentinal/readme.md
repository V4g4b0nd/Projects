This is a project done on mapping failed event login attempts(or a bruteforce attempts) on a windows machine which is open to the internet.
we either turn firewall off or put ICMP requests to allow.
After catching the logs, we run a powershell script inside the machine and by using Workspace Analytics, Log Analytics, Cloud Defender and Azure Sentinal; we pull these log out and maps it to the worldmap and see how many attempts have generated from all around the world

Thanks to **Josh Madakor** for taking the time and effort in teaching this project. It is really fun
