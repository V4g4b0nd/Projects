Working 

 

FIM --> Start -->  

Ask user what they want to do 

A) Collect new baseline 

B) Begin monitoring files with saved baseline 

 

A) --> Calculate Hash value from Target files (Hash is taking the digital thumbprint of a text file and stores in a text file) 

     --> Store the file or Hash pairs in Baseline.txt 

 

B) --> Load file or Hash pair from the existing Baseline.txt 

     --> Loop through each target file, calculate the hash and compare the file or hash to baseline.txt 

     --> Notify user if a file is changed or deleted 

     --> If a file's actual hash is different than what is recorded in baseline, print in the screen. 

If a file is deleted, says Integrity Compromise
